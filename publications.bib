  journal = {Annual Review of Linguistics},
  credit = {Writing - Review & Editing},
  abstract = {Language use in everyday life can be studied using lightweight, wearable recorders that collect long-form recordings—that is, audio (including speech) over whole days. The hardware and software underlying this technique are increasingly accessible and inexpensive, and these data are revolutionizing the language acquisition field. We first place this technique into the broader context of the current ways of studying both the input being received by children and children's own language production, laying out the main advantages and drawbacks of long-form recordings. We then go on to argue that a unique advantage of long-form recordings is that they can fuel realistic models of early language acquisition that use speech to represent children's input and/or to establish production benchmarks. To enable the field to make the most of this unique empirical and conceptual contribution, we outline what this reverse engineering approach from long-form recordings entails, why it is useful, and how to evaluate success.},

  credit = {Conceptualization, Software, Writing - Original Draft},
  abstract = {The technique of long-form recordings via wearables is gaining momentum in different fields of research, notably linguistics and neurology. This technique, however, poses several technical challenges, some of which are amplified by the peculiarities of the data, including their sensitivity and their volume. In this paper, we begin by outlining key problems related to the management, storage, and sharing of the corpora that emerge when using this technique. We continue by proposing a multi-component solution to these problems, specifically in the case of daylong recordings of children. As part of this solution, we release ChildProject, a Python package for performing the operations typically required by such datasets and for evaluating the reliability of annotations using a number of measures commonly used in speech processing and linguistics. This package builds upon an annotation management system, which allows the importation of annotations from a wide range of existing formats, as well as upon data validation procedures, which assert the conformity of the data, or, alternatively, produce detailed and explicit error reports. Our proposal could be generalized to populations other than children and beyond linguistics.},

  title = {Vocal input and output among infants in a multilingual context: Evidence from long-form recordings in Vanuatu},
  journal = {Developmental Science},
  credit = {Data Curation, Formal analysis, Writing - Review & Editing},
  abstract = {What are the vocal experiences of children growing up on Malakula island, Vanuatu, where multilingualism is the norm? Long-form audio-recordings captured spontaneous speech behavior by, and around, 38 children (5–33 months, 23 girls) from 11 villages. Automated analyses revealed most children's vocal input came from female adults and other children's voices, with small contributions from male adult voices. The greatest changes with age involved an increase in the input vocalizations from other children. Total input (collapsing across child-directed and overheard speech, and across languages) was ∼11 min per hour, which was at least 5 min (31%) lower than that found in other populations studied using comparable methods in previous literature, as well as in archival American data analyzed with the same algorithm. In contrast, children's own vocalization counts were two to four times higher than previous reports for North-American English-learning monolingual infants at matched ages, and comparable to estimates from archival American data, consistent with a resilient language-learning cognitive system for this aspect of vocal development. The strongest association between input and output was with vocalizations by other children, rather than those by adults, which is consistent with research in anthropology but less so with current theoretical trends in developmental psychology. These results invite further research in populations that are under-represented in developmental science.},

  title = {How research programs come apart: the example of supersymmetry and the disunity of physics},
  journal = {Quantitative Science Studies},
  credit = {Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Formal analysis, Data Curation, Writing - Original Draft, Visualization},
  abstract = {According to Peter Galison, the coordination of different “subcultures” within a scientific field happens through local exchanges within “trading zones”. In his view, the workability of such trading zones is not guaranteed, and science is not necessarily driven towards further integration. In this paper, we develop and apply quantitative methods (using semantic, authorship, and citation data from scientific literature), inspired by Galison’s framework, to the case of the disunity of high-energy physics. We give prominence to supersymmetry, a concept that has given rise to several major but distinct research programs in the field, such as the formulation of a consistent theory of quantum gravity or the search for new particles. We show that “theory” and “phenomenology” in high-energy physics should be regarded as distinct theoretical subcultures, between which supersymmetry has helped sustain scientific “trades”. However, as we demonstrate using a topic model, the phenomenological component of supersymmetry research has lost traction and the ability of supersymmetry to tie these subcultures together is now compromised. Our work supports that even fields with an initially strong commitment to unity may eventually generate diverging research programs and demonstrates the fruitfulness of the notion of trading zones for informing quantitative approaches to scientific pluralism.},

We showed that the number of deaths attributed to Covid significantly underestimated the actual number of deaths. We then showed that the government later reduced the discrepancy by accounting for Covid-related deaths occurring in nursing homes, but that there remained an unaccounted for excess mortality in deaths occurring at home that could be attributed to Covid.
